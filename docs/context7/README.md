Context 7 by Upstach is an MCP server designed to keep AI-powered coding assistants up-to-date with the latest documentation and examples, eliminating stale or hallucinated code. Traditional tools like Cursor or Windsurf often struggle to index and use new API docs—leading to errors or outdated suggestions. Context 7 solves this by maintaining its own library of docs (e.g., Supabase) that it dynamically pulls into the model’s context on demand.
