# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Guide

## What is a PRD?

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) is a comprehensive document that defines the purpose, features, functionality, and behavior of a product or feature. It serves as a blueprint that guides the development team throughout the implementation process.

## Essential Components of a PRD

### 1. Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: Brief overview of what the product/feature does and why it's being built
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem being solved
- **Target Users**: Who will use this product/feature
- **Success Metrics**: How success will be measured

### 2. Background and Context
- **Market Analysis**: Current market conditions and opportunities
- **Competitive Analysis**: How competitors address similar problems
- **Business Case**: ROI, revenue potential, or cost savings
- **Strategic Alignment**: How this fits into broader company goals

### 3. User Stories and Use Cases
- **User Personas**: Detailed descriptions of target user types
- **User Journey Maps**: Step-by-step flows of how users will interact
- **Scenarios**: Specific situations where the product will be used
- **Jobs to be Done**: What tasks users are trying to accomplish

### 4. Functional Requirements
- **Core Features**: Must-have functionality
- **Feature Descriptions**: Detailed explanation of each feature
- **User Interface Requirements**: UI/UX specifications
- **System Behaviors**: How the system responds to various inputs
- **Business Logic**: Rules and calculations

### 5. Technical Requirements
- **Performance Requirements**: Speed, load times, concurrent users
- **Scalability Requirements**: Growth expectations
- **Security Requirements**: Data protection, authentication, authorization
- **Integration Requirements**: APIs, third-party services, existing systems
- **Platform Requirements**: Supported devices, browsers, OS versions

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader support
- **Localization**: Language and regional requirements
- **Compliance**: Legal and regulatory requirements
- **Data Requirements**: Storage, retention, privacy policies

### 7. Constraints and Assumptions
- **Technical Constraints**: Existing system limitations
- **Resource Constraints**: Budget, timeline, team size
- **Dependencies**: External systems or teams
- **Assumptions**: Conditions assumed to be true

### 8. Success Criteria and Metrics
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Measurable goals
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions for feature completion
- **Analytics Requirements**: What data to track
- **Testing Criteria**: How to validate functionality

### 9. Timeline and Milestones
- **Development Phases**: Breaking down the work
- **Key Milestones**: Important dates and deliverables
- **Release Plan**: Rollout strategy
- **Post-Launch Plan**: Monitoring and iteration

### 10. Appendices
- **Mockups and Wireframes**: Visual representations
- **Technical Diagrams**: Architecture, data flow, etc.
- **Glossary**: Definition of terms
- **References**: Related documents and resources

## Best Practices for Writing PRDs

### Be Specific and Clear
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions
- Define all technical terms and acronyms
- Avoid ambiguous language like "fast" or "user-friendly"

### Focus on the "What" and "Why", Not "How"
- Describe what needs to be built and why
- Leave implementation details to the development team
- Focus on outcomes rather than specific solutions

### Include Visual Elements
- Use diagrams, flowcharts, and mockups
- Create user journey maps
- Include screenshots of competitive products

### Keep It Living Document
- Version control your PRDs
- Update as requirements change
- Track decisions and rationale

### Structure for Readability
- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Use bullet points and numbered lists
- Highlight critical requirements

## Tips for Task Master Integration

When writing PRDs for Task Master parsing:

1. **Use Clear Hierarchical Structure**: Task Master can better parse well-structured documents
2. **Be Explicit About Dependencies**: Clearly state which features depend on others
3. **Include Test Strategies**: Describe how each feature should be tested
4. **Break Down Complex Features**: Divide large features into smaller, manageable components
5. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent heading styles and bullet points

Task Master will parse your PRD and generate a hierarchical task structure based on the requirements and features you define.
